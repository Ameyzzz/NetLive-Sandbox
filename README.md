NetLive-Sandbox

NetLive-Sandbox is a Visual Studio Code extension built for web developers who want to streamline their workflow and reduce the friction between writing code, testing APIs, and debugging results. Traditionally, developers are forced to switch constantly between their editor, browser, and mock API tools just to verify small changes. With NetLive-Sandbox, all of this happens inside VSCode‚Äîmaking the editor itself a powerful sandbox for web prototyping.

üöÄ What is NetLive-Sandbox?
NetLive-Sandbox provides a lightweight sandbox environment where you can:
Prototype websites directly in VSCode without constantly jumping to an external browser.
Test API calls instantly using a simple config file (api.config.js) that plugs directly into your project.
Swap between mock and real APIs in seconds, making it ideal for early-stage experiments.
Debug faster, because your API responses, frontend logic, and project output are all visible in one place.
At its core, the extension works with a straightforward design:
An api.config.js file defines your API endpoints.
Your main project code (e.g., main.js) consumes those endpoints.
The extension bridges everything seamlessly, letting you focus on development instead of setup.

üîë Why Developers Love It
Zero Context Switching ‚Üí Code, test, and debug without leaving VSCode.
Rapid Prototyping ‚Üí Replace or mock APIs with a single edit.
Lightweight by Design ‚Üí No extra servers, no bloated dependencies‚Äîjust your editor and your code.
Built for Speed ‚Üí Designed specifically for frontend developers who want to validate ideas quickly.

üåê How It Works
Create or edit api.config.js to point to your API (mock or real).
Import the config into your main.js.
The extension automatically hooks everything together.
From there, every API call in your code runs through the sandbox, making it easy to swap endpoints, test responses, or integrate new APIs without rewriting your entire project.

üß© Example Use Cases
Frontend Prototyping ‚Üí Quickly test how your UI looks with different APIs.
Mock API Development ‚Üí Start building before the backend is even ready.
API Debugging ‚Üí See how responses affect your project instantly.
Teaching & Learning ‚Üí Great for students or teams learning how to connect frontend apps to APIs.

üéØ Vision
NetLive-Sandbox was created with one goal: to make VSCode a self-contained sandbox for web projects. By giving developers the ability to design, test, and debug in one environment, it eliminates distractions and accelerates the journey from idea ‚Üí prototype ‚Üí working demo.
This is just the beginning. The long-term vision is for NetLive-Sandbox to become the go-to tool for rapid web development inside VSCode, empowering developers to innovate without being slowed down by setup overheads.# NetLive-Sandbox
NetLive-Sandbox is a VSCode extension that lets web devs develop websites without leaving VSCode. It provides a simple api.config.js for managing endpoints and integrates smoothly with main.js, enabling faster prototyping and debugging.
